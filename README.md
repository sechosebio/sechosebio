### Hi there 👋

🙋 My name is Jose (/ho'se/), I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building digital products, solving problems, and learning new things. 

💼 For The last decade, I've been gaining experience with different technologies, companies and countries, from backend to frontend, from mobile to web, and from startups to big companies. 

🧑‍💻 I'm a big fan of functional programming since my years at the [University](https://fic.udc.es/), so I'd say my favourite programming language is Elixir, which I've been using for the last few years. 

🛠️ My toolbox is composed of different technologies, and I'm always open to learning new ones. For the last few years, I've been working with Elixir, Ruby, Javascript and Typescript, React, React Native, GraphQL, Java, Docker and Kubernetes. 

😎 But, this journey isn't just code, I'm always learning and investigating new things, not only tech-related, but also cooking, music, etc. And why not say it? I like to read Wikipedia, I'm a huge fan of the [On This Day section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:On_this_day/Today). But above all these things, spending time with my family is priority number one.

🚀 Let's connect, collaborate and share knowledge. Whether it's about code, music, cooking or dissecting historical trivia, I'm all ears, you can find me on:
